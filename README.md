# Pick A Number
This console based guessing game challenges the user to pick a number between some range of numbers. Each time they make a guess they will be told whether their guess is too high or too low until they successfully guess the number. The goal is to guess the number in the fewest number of tries.

## Motivation
This is my take on the first project in Treehouse's Python Techdegree program.

## Features
* When the game begins players are welcome and informed of their best score so far
* Players use the console to try and guess a number between 1 and 10
* If they do not correctly guess the number, they are informed if the number is higher or lower
* If they guess a number that is not between 1 and 10 or enter something other than a number an exception is raised
* One they correctly guess the number they are informed of how many tries it took and they have the option to play again
* If they enter anything besides an upper or lower case Y or N in the play again input an exception is raised
